<p align="center"><i>An API/Library for any race/pace-related activities, written in Go.</i></p>

## Usage

This is a work in progress. Currently the only tool is the pace/course grid where a series of "races" with
a set of pacing segments are read from a JSON file. The idea is to expand this in to a REST API and create useful
race charting tools/graphs.
